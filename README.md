# Background
In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

# Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze and evaluate the model we created, to determine if it is a model that can return both accurate and precise results. Below, I have described the accuracy, precision, and recall scores, and will summarize the results.
    - Accuracy: The model is accurate 99% of the time meaning it correctly predicts 99% of the instances
    - Precision: For class 0, the model is precise 100% of the time, and for class 1, the model is precise 87% of the time. This means that when identified as a good loan, the model is     precise 100% of the time, and bad loans are correctly identified 89% of the time.
    - Recall Scores: For class 0, the recall score is 100%, while it is 89% for class 1. This means, 100% of the class 0 loans are identified, while 89% of the class 1 loans are recalled as class 1 loans.

Overall, this model has high precision, accuracy, and recall scores show this model is a good fit for the data, and can accurtely, precisely, and completely predict which loans will be good while which ones will also be bad. As it is a predictive model, it can make mistakes, but the percentage of  inaccuracies, lack of precision and lack of recall are quite low, meaning this is a well-fitted predictive model.
